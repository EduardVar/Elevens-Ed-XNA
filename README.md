# Instructions:
## Goal:
Remove all cards from the deck and have them on the field.

## How:
Match up card pairs that add up to 11 (based on rank) by clicking them. The Ace card has a value of 1. 
You can deselect cards by clicking them again. 
Successful pairs will have cards placed on top of them from the deck. 

### Important:
Jack, Queen, and King cards cannot be selected to be used for pairing.
If the first card of a stack on the table is a Jack, Queen or King, it can be clicked on to shuffle it into the deck and replace it with a different card.
Note: This action will only work with the FIRST royalty of a card stack!
 
## Losing:
You lose the game when there are no pairs on your screen that add up to 11.
